# Code of Conduct

We value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure that every contributor has an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, everyone who participates in the Vermont Complex Systems Institute (VCSI) website project is expected to show respect and courtesy to other community members at all times.

The **VCSI website community** is dedicated to a ***welcoming and harassment-free experience for everyone***, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, nationality, or academic background. **We do not tolerate harassment by and/or of members of our community in any form**.

We are particularly motivated to support:
- New and/or anxious collaborators
- People who are looking to learn and develop their skills
- Anyone who has experienced discrimination in the past
- Undergraduate and graduate students contributing to the project
- Faculty, staff, and community members from diverse backgrounds

To make clear what is expected, we ask all members of the community to conform to the following Code of Conduct.

**This document is organized in 4 parts:**
1. [Overview](#1-code-of-conduct-overview) - Summary and scope
2. [Details](#2-code-of-conduct-details) - Expected and unacceptable behaviors
3. [Reporting](#3-incident-reporting-guidelines) - How to report incidents
4. [Enforcement](#4-enforcement-manual) - How reports are handled

The last section acknowledges the sources this Code of Conduct has been built upon.

## 1 Code of Conduct: Overview

The VCSI website is a community-oriented and collaborative project. We value the involvement of everyone in the community—faculty, staff, students, and researchers—and are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching, and contributing.

All participants in activities associated with the VCSI website project are expected to show respect and courtesy to others at all times.

**This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces related to the VCSI website project**, including but not limited to:
- GitHub repository interactions (issues, pull requests, discussions)
- Email communications about the project
- In-person meetings or events related to the project
- Online collaboration platforms (Slack, Zoom, etc.)

### Contact for Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting:

**Primary Contact:**
- Email: [vcsi@uvm.edu](mailto:vcsi@uvm.edu) (reaches VCSI leadership)

**University Resources:**
- UVM Office of Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity: [aaeo@uvm.edu](mailto:aaeo@uvm.edu)
- UVM Dean of Students Office: [deanofstudents@uvm.edu](mailto:deanofstudents@uvm.edu)

Reports will be handled confidentially and reviewed by appropriate project maintainers or university officials, as needed. If there is a conflict of interest with the primary contact, please use one of the university resources listed above.

# 2 Code of Conduct: Details

The VCSI website project team is dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. As such, we do not tolerate behavior that is disrespectful to our community members or that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others.

We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not limited to:
- Gender identity and expression
- Sexual orientation
- Disability
- Physical appearance or body size
- Citizenship or nationality
- Ethnic or social origin
- Pregnancy or familial status
- Veteran status
- Genetic information
- Religion or belief (or lack thereof)
- Age or education level
- Socio-economic status
- Technical choices and experience level
- Academic discipline or research focus

Everyone who participates in the VCSI website project is required to conform to this Code of Conduct. By participating, contributors indicate their acceptance of the procedures by which the project team resolves any Code of Conduct incidents.

## 2.1 Expected Behaviour

We are confident that our community members will together build a supportive and collaborative atmosphere at our events and during online communications.
The following bullet points set out explicitly what we hope you will consider to be appropriate community guidelines:

* **Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences**. Do not engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ageist, ableist, sexist, or otherwise exclusionary behaviour.
* **Use welcoming and inclusive language**. Exclusionary comments or jokes, threats or violent language are not acceptable. Do not address others in an angry, intimidating, or demeaning manner. Be considerate of the ways the words you choose may impact others. Be patient and respectful of the fact that English is a second (or third or fourth!) language for some participants.
* **Do not harass people**. Harassment includes unwanted physical contact, sexual attention, or repeated social contact. Know that consent is explicit, conscious and continuous—not implied. If you are unsure whether your behaviour towards another person is welcome, ask them. If someone tells you to stop, do so.
* **Respect the privacy and safety of others**. Do not take photographs of others without their permission. Do not share other participants’ personal experiences without their express permission. Note that posting (or threatening to post) personally identifying information of others without their consent ("doxing") is a form of harassment.
* **Be considerate of others’ participation**. Everyone should have an opportunity to be heard. In update sessions, please keep comments succinct so as to allow maximum engagement by all participants. Do not interrupt others on the basis of disagreement; hold such comments until they have finished speaking.
* **Don’t be a bystander**. If you see something inappropriate happening, speak up. If you don't feel comfortable intervening but feel someone should, please feel free to ask a member of the Code of Conduct response team for support.
* As an overriding general rule, please **be intentional in your actions and humble in your mistakes**.

All interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person.
See [this explanation of the four social rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules) - no feigning surprise, no well-actually's, no back-seat driving, no subtle -isms - for further recommendations for inclusive behaviours.

## 2.2 Unacceptable Behaviour

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by Turing Way community members at any project event or platform include:

* written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership in any specific group
* causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation
* violent threats or language directed against another person
* the display of sexual or violent images
* unwelcome sexual attention
* nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
* sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
* insults or put-downs
* sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
* excessive swearing
* incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
* continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop
* publication of private communication without consent

## 2.3 Consequences of Unacceptable Behaviour

Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately. This applies to all VCSI website project spaces and platforms, both online and in-person.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, project maintainers may take action including but not limited to:
- Warning the offender
- Temporary suspension from project activities
- Permanent removal from the project
- Reporting to appropriate university authorities


## 2.4 Feedback

This Code of Conduct is not intended as a static set of rules by which everyone must abide. Rather, you are invited to make suggestions for updates or clarifications by:
- Emailing the VCSI team at [vcsi@uvm.edu](mailto:vcsi@uvm.edu)
- Opening an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Vermont-Complex-Systems/vcsi-website/issues)
- Making a pull request to this document on GitHub

We welcome community input to ensure this Code of Conduct remains relevant and effective.

# 3 Incident Reporting Guidelines

## 3.1 Contact Points

If you experience or witness a Code of Conduct violation, please report it promptly. You have multiple options:

**Primary Contact:**
- **VCSI Email**: [vcsi@uvm.edu](mailto:vcsi@uvm.edu) - Reaches VCSI leadership who are responsible for enforcing this Code of Conduct

**University Resources (for serious concerns or if you prefer):**
- **UVM Office of Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity**: [EqualOpportunity@uvm.edu ](mailto:EqualOpportunity@uvm.edu ) or 802-656-3368
- **UVM Dean of Students Office**: [DeanOfStudents@uvm.edu](mailto:DeanOfStudents@uvm.edu) or (802) 656-3380

## 3.2 What to Include in a Report

When reporting an incident, please include as much of the following information as possible:
- Your contact information (if you're comfortable sharing)
- Names of people involved (or descriptions if names are unknown)
- Description of the incident, including specific behaviors
- Date, time, and location (physical or digital platform)
- Whether the incident is ongoing
- Any additional context that may be helpful
- Whether you've reported this elsewhere (e.g., to UVM authorities)

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and confidentially.

## 3.3 Anonymous Reporting

If you prefer to remain anonymous, you can:
- Submit a report through UVM's anonymous reporting systems
- Ask a trusted colleague to submit a report on your behalf
- Contact university resources who can help facilitate anonymous reporting

## 3.4 What to Do If Someone Is in Physical Danger

If you believe someone is in immediate physical danger:
- **Call 911** for emergency services
- **UVM Police Services**: (802) 656-3473 (emergency) or (802) 656-3444 (non-emergency)
- Remove yourself from the situation if you feel unsafe
- Report the incident using the contacts above as soon as it's safe to do so

## 3.5 Code of Conduct Enforcement

A detailed enforcement policy is available in the [Enforcement Manual](#4-enforcement-manual) below.

# 4 Enforcement Manual

This enforcement manual is used by the VCSI website project team when responding to Code of Conduct incidents to ensure consistency and fairness. Enforcement of the Code of Conduct should be respectful and not include any harassing behaviors.

## 4.1 Urgent Situations: Acting Unilaterally

If an incident involves physical danger or a threat to anyone's safety (such as threats of violence), any project team member or community member may—and should—act unilaterally to protect the safety of any community member. This can include:
- Contacting law enforcement or emergency services
- Contacting UVM Police Services or campus security
- Immediately removing someone from a physical or digital space
- Speaking on behalf of the VCSI website project team

If an act is ongoing, any authorized team member may act immediately, before reaching consensus, to defuse the situation. In situations where someone acts unilaterally, they must inform the project leadership as soon as possible, ideally within 24 hours.

## 4.2 Less-Urgent Situations

Upon receiving a report of an incident, the project team will review the incident and determine, to the best of their ability:

- Whether this is an ongoing situation
- Whether there is a threat to anyone's physical safety
- What happened
- Whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation
- Who was involved and what actions were taken

This information will be collected either in person or in writing. The review team will provide a written summary of the information surrounding the incident. All participants will be anonymized in the summary report, referred to as "Community Member 1," "Community Member 2," or "Team Member 1." The de-anonymizing information will be kept in a separate, secure file and only accessed if needed to identify patterns of behavior over time.

**Timeline for Resolution:**
- The project team will aim to acknowledge receipt of a report within 48 hours
- The team will aim to have a resolution agreed upon within one week
- If a resolution cannot be determined in that time, the team will respond to the reporter(s) with an update and projected timeline for resolution

All reports will be kept confidential to the extent possible, shared only with those who need to know to investigate and resolve the issue.

## 4.3 Resolutions

The project team will seek to agree on a resolution by consensus of all members investigating the report.

**Possible responses may include:**

- **No action** - If the issue reported is not a violation or is outside the scope of this Code of Conduct
- **Mediated conversation** - A facilitated discussion between the impacted community members
- **Apology** - A request for a verbal or written apology, public or private, from a community member
- **Educational intervention** - Providing resources or guidance on appropriate behavior
- **Warning** - A private or public warning clarifying community responsibilities
- **Private conversation** - A one-on-one discussion between a team member and the individual(s) involved (documented in writing)
- **Written reprimand** - A formal written reprimand delivered via email (documented)
- **Temporary suspension** - A "time out" from project spaces (GitHub, meetings, etc.) for a specified period
- **Permanent ban** - Permanent removal from some or all project spaces
- **Reporting to authorities** - In serious cases, reporting to UVM officials or law enforcement

The team will maintain records of all sanctions for future reference and pattern identification.

**Communicating the Resolution:**

Once a resolution is agreed upon but before it is enacted, a member of the project team will:
1. Contact the original reporter and any other affected parties
2. Explain the proposed resolution
3. Ask if this resolution is acceptable and note feedback for the record

The project team will consider this feedback but is not required to change the resolution based on it. However, reporter feedback is valued and will be documented as part of the incident record.

## 4.4 Conflicts of Interest

If a report involves a member of the project team:
- The report should be sent to another member of the team who is not involved
- The person involved in the report will recuse themselves from the investigation and resolution process

## 4.5 Appeals

If any party (reporter or reported individual) believes the resolution was unjust, they may appeal by:
- Contacting [jonathan.st-onge@uvm.edu](mailto:jonathan.st-onge@uvm.edu) within 7 days of the resolution
- Providing a written explanation of why the resolution should be reconsidered
- The team will review the appeal and respond within two weeks

Appeals will be considered for:
- New evidence that was not available during the initial investigation
- Procedural errors in handling the case
- Disproportionate sanctions relative to the violation
