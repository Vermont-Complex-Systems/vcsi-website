Abstract:
Network studies have long explored the relationship between network structure and stability. In particular, network robustness measures the resistance of a network to node extinction. In other words, how likely is it for a failure at one node to spread and cause a catastrophic and cascading collapse of the network? Although these are well-explored dynamics in theoretical and simulated network studies, rarely have predicted extinctions in networks been compared against real-world observed extinctions. In this talk, I'll discuss a project to generate predicted extinction cascades in Gulf of Maine coastal food webs and a series of observational and experimental tests of these predicted extinctions, bringing together theory, simulation, and empirical studies in a highly perturbed ecosystem.",Talkboctopus Seminar Series: S4 Episode 7: Allison Barner

Abstract:
For a few centuries, scientists have described natural phenomena by means of relatively simple mathematical models such as Newton's law of gravitation or Snell's law of refraction. Sometimes, they found these models deductively, starting from fundamental considerations; more frequently, however, they derived the models inductively from data. With increasing amounts of data available for all sorts of (natural and social) systems, one may argue that we are now in a position to inductively uncover new interpretable models for these systems. But can this process be authomatized? That is, can we design algorithms that automatically learn, from data, the closed-form mathematical models that generated them? And if so, are the true generating models always learnable? In the talk I will discuss how we can use inference approaches to define what we call a Bayesian machine scientists which can obtain closed-form mathematical models from data. We will see how often, noisy observations result in there being multiple models that can describe our data well. Nonetheless, with our approach we can show that there is a transition occurring between: (i) a learnable phase at low observation noise, in which the true model can in principle be learned from the data; and (ii) an unlearnable phase, in which the observation noise is too large for the true model to be learned from the data by any method.

From online recommender platforms to financial predictions, machine learning systems are in active feedback with the surrounding environment and have the ability to steer the underlying data distributions toward different targets. While traditionally neglected, these causal forces of prediction have been recently formalized in a new risk minimization framework called performative prediction.

Following a brief overview of the performative prediction framework, in this talk, I will present some work that directly tries to address the distinction between forecasting future outcomes and steering data distributions toward socially desirable targets. Building upon a new line of research in supervised learning, we introduce the idea of performative omnipredictors. These are simple predictive models that simultaneously encode the optimal decision rule with respect to many possibly-competing objectives. As part of our presentation, we will discuss some connections with the outcome indistinguishability literature and illustrate how the solution concepts we introduce enable decision-makers to flexibly decide on the goals of prediction in performative settings.

Abstract:
We are in a golden age of core ideas from network theory being applied to make progress on major questions in economics. This talk will present two examples of this from my work, both concerning the incentives of firms in economic production.  In the first paper I'll discuss, we model the production of complex goods in a large supply network, where specific relationships, or contracts, between firms are essential. A supply network is called fragile if aggregate output is very sensitive to small aggregate shocks. We model both the mechanics and the strategic forces that determine network robustness. By building a new interface between percolation theory and canonical models of economic production, we show that supply networks of intermediate productivity are fragile in equilibrium, even though this is always inefficient.
The second paper also focuses on a network of firms, but now the key interaction arises from how the demand for a firm's output is affected by other firms' choices: the firms sell goods that are either consumed together or are substitutes (competitors) for one another. The main questions are: how volatile are prices and measures of economic welfare to economic shocks (e.g., changes in commodity prices), and how should a planner intervene to improve the welfare a market delivers? Our main conceptual contribution is to use a certain basis of the goods space, determined by the network of interactions among suppliers. It consists of principal components. By developing a new approach for using this principal component perspective to analyze the market, we can give new and sharp answers to both main questions. The results permit us to leverage the theory of spectral approximation (recently attracting a lot of interest in the statistical analysis of big data) to design optimal interventions even when the demand system is observed with a lot of noise.

Mathematical models of curiosity

Abstract: 
What is curiosity? Is it an emotion? A behavior? A cognitive process? Curiosity seems to be an abstract concept—like love, perhaps, or justice—far from the realm of those bits of nature that mathematics can possibly address. However, contrary to intuition, it turns out that the leading theories of curiosity are surprisingly amenable to formalization in the mathematics of network science. In this talk, I will unpack some of those theories, and show how they can be formalized in the mathematics of networks. Then, I will describe relevant data from human behavior and linguistic corpora, and ask which theories that data supports. Throughout, I will make a case for the position that individual and collective curiosity are both network building processes, providing a connective counterpoint to the common acquisitional account of curiosity in humans.

Building a framework for population-scale network analysis

Abstract:  
Traditional network analysis methods become unfeasible when addressing the structure of large-scale networks. First, it is computationally too expensive and even irrelevant to calculate centrality scores for networks of millions of people. Second, and more importantly, one-mode networks (and pairwise interactions) are insufficient as they disregard the crucial role that organizations play in forming social structures. Thus, a more realistic approach to general population structures is crucial to enhance data collection methods, study design in several fields, and policy-making.

In the talk, I will discuss the main points and concepts we are considering for building a framework that spotlights organizations (collective interactions). The framework emphasizes that ties between actors arise and evolve according to the organizations to which they belong, a notion straightforwardly modeled through two-mode and projected networks. I argue that structural properties such as tie strength, heterogeneity of actor popularity and strength, clustering, communities, and segregation emerge from homophily, jointly with overlap and social activity–two mechanisms we introduce in this framework. That is, the framework challenges the widely accepted role of preferential attachment and triadic closure as primary mechanisms of social network formation. Our results so far show that organization size distributions modulate network structures by interweaving with social activity distributions and that overlap increases segregation from a network viewpoint. The framework’s implications are broad, potentially affecting the study design of several social processes ranging from social cohesion, tolerance, and child development to the spread of infectious diseases.

Diversity and heterogeneity can improve the efficiency of collective decisions

Talk Abstract:
Many organisms regularly make decisions regarding foraging, home-site selection, mating, and danger avoidance in groups ranging from hundreds up to millions of individuals. These decisions involve evidence-accumulation processes by individuals and information exchange within the group. Moreover, these decisions take place in complex, dynamic, and spatially structured environments, which shape the flow of information between group mates. We will present a statistical inference model for framing evidence accumulation and belief sharing in groups and some examples of how interactions shape decision efficiency in groups. Our canonical model is of Bayesian agents deciding between two equally likely options by accumulating evidence to a threshold. First passage times and error rates can be accurately estimated using asymptotics for order statistics in the limit of large group sizes. When neighbors only share their decisions with each other, groups comprised of individuals with a distribution of decision thresholds make more efficient decisions than homogeneous ones. To conclude, we will briefly discuss specific examples of the impacts of spatial and communication heterogeneity on collective decision making in foraging animal groups like honey bees and primates.

Something from nothing: transfer learning and the global structure of species interaction networks

Abstract:
Despite their importance in many ecological processes, collecting data and information on ecological interactions is an exceedingly challenging task. For this reason, large parts of the world have a data deficit when it comes to species interactions, and how the resulting networks are structured. As data collection alone is unlikely to be sufficient, community ecologists must adopt predictive methods. We present a methodological framework that uses graph embedding and transfer learning to assemble a predicted list of trophic interactions of a species pool for which their interactions are unknown. Specifically, we ‘learn’ the information (latent traits) of species from a known interaction network and infer the latent traits of another species pool for which we have no a priori interaction data based on their phylogenetic relatedness to species from the known network. The latent traits can then be used to predict interactions and construct an interaction network. Here we assembled a metaweb for Canadian mammals derived from interactions in the European food web, despite only 4% of common species being shared between the two locations. The results of the predictive model are compared against databases of recorded pairwise interactions, showing that we correctly recover 91% of known interactions. The framework itself is robust even when the known network is incomplete or contains spurious interactions making it an ideal candidate as a tool for filling gaps when it comes to species interactions. We provide guidance on how this framework can be adapted by substituting some approaches or predictors in order to make it more generally applicable.

Systems thinking and structural explanations in responsible AI

Abstract: 
Recently the concepts of trustworthy and responsible AI have gained prominence in industry, academia, government, and civil society as an AI governance rallying cry. These umbrella terms serve as useful, albeit often vacuous, ways to conceptually organize the myriad efforts to establish common standards, rules, and guardrails for the development and use of data-driven decision-making systems. The key gap in the efforts to make algorithmic systems---and the decision making they effect---responsible is an understanding of complex systems and social structures. Furthermore, this gap is revealed when algorithmic systems lead to unintended harms, where 'AI accidents' reveal underlying social structure. Drawing on examples from ranking systems, the mortgage market, algorithmic discovery and algorithmic accidents, I will discuss several recent efforts to bridge understandings of complex social systems with this emerging field.

The wisdom of crowds in naturalistic conditions

Abstract:
The ‘wisdom of crowds’ (whereby groups of humans or animals make better decisions than individuals) has attracted a great deal of attention, inspiring many researchers to search for signals of it across many species and contexts. However, the model that this intuition is based on is highly simplistic and its assumptions are easily violated when real animals make decisions in real environments. Here, I describe a series of models that I’ve developed with collaborators that add in features of natural environments to models of collective decision-making. We find that these features tend to substantially alter, and sometimes reverse, our predictions of how the wisdom of crowds behaves in nature, and reveals several new mechanisms by which animals could potentially exploit to improve their decision accuracy when living in a group.

Abstract: Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) organizations, both in the government and the industry, are facing two daunting challenges. First, the acute failures in developing complex engineered artifacts, which are often manifested in cost and schedule overruns. The second is the lack of diversity in STEM fields. Despite a large fraction of STEM organizations report to have an active diversity policy, there remains a significant underrepresentation of women, racial, and ethnic minorities, in addition to often overlooked deep-level diversity features such as knowledge. While the open innovation (OI) literature hints at its potential to alleviate both of these issues, research on leveraging OI as a sociotechnical mechanism that could serve both as an effective systems architecting tool and as a more inclusive policy instrument for innovation, have been nascent. As such, it is unclear if the crowd can contribute to complex STEM problems with high-degrees of interdependencies or if the subset of the crowd that can deliver transferrable knowledge is actually more diverse compared to the internal workforce of the STEM agencies. This talk outlines an opportunity to re-think system design processes with an awareness of who will solve and how the solvers will engage in the design process. I will demonstrate that joint consideration of problem formulation, organizational knowledge, and outside expertise could significantly improve design process outcomes; and discuss strategies for incorporating solver-awareness into the architecting process. Then, I will present evidence from a unique NASA field experiment, probing into the efficacy and the extent of crowdsourcing to serve the diversity policy goals of STEM organizations. Finally, I will discuss how mixed-methods research approaches could help to develop a novel sociotechnical theory for architecting complex systems.

Talk Title:

Informing fishery sustainability with network ecology


Talk Abstract:

The world is facing a fisheries crisis, with fish stocks and marine ecosystems collapsing due to human over-exploitation. Understanding the interconnectedness among species in harvested ecosystems and the dynamic responses of ecosystems to fishing is critical for informing managing practices to attain fisheries’ sustainability. Two of our recent publications evaluate such interconnectedness among dozens of species in harvested ecosystems using network analysis, mathematical models and computational tools. First, we investigate the combined effects of artisanal fisheries and climate change on an intertidal food web of the Central Coast of Chile. We show that climate change has a stronger effect on the food web than artisanal fisheries. Second, we incorporate economic rules governing fish extraction based on fish price and yield to evaluate how economic dynamics affect food webs and cause species extinctions. Our work exemplifies the importance of studying the effects of fisheries on the entire food web, instead of only focusing on the target species, and of introducing humans as dynamic components into food web models to answer questions of fisheries sustainability.

Talk Title:
Ecological Networks in Dynamics LandscapesTalk Abstract:

Network ecology is an emerging field allowing researchers to conceptualize and model complex and dynamic ecological systems. Here, I highlight the parallel developments in ecological network studies and spatial network applications and their convergence in the use of network theory. Then, I summarize how ecological, spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal networks can be formalized into the framework of multilayer networks. Specifically, I present how the spatio-temporal network can be analysed focusing either on the dynamics on the network or of the network. Such distinctions provide the foundations for the formulation of an “ecological network dynamics hypothesis” (ENDH) stating key network topologies that constrain the dynamic of ecological systems. Such an ENDH could in turn permit assessing trade-offs in network topologies and functions that affect the persistence of ecological systems. I then propose the integration of ecological networks with spatial networks to improve our understanding of complex ecological systems. This integration combines filtering the ecological interaction network based on motifs with the delineation of patches in the spatial network using an edge detection algorithm scalable to species dispersal abilities. I conclude that network ecology with its analytical methods will improve our understanding on how ecological systems will respond in spatially dynamic landscapes.

Talk title: Science for the next pandemic: from large-scale simulations of genes to 3-D reconstructions of chromosomes




Abstract: While most cells in the body have identical 1-D genomes, cells in different tissues have remarkably different cell shapes, internal structures and functionality. Recent studies suggest that the 3-D structure of the genome differs from cell to cell, and that these differences have profound effects on the function of the underlying DNA, impacting cell structure and functionality. Interestingly, viral infections also affect the 3-D organization of the genome. While the common paradigm suggests that chromosome compaction causes gene silencing, few mechanistic studies on full chromosomes have been performed to support this. Recently, the development of high throughput sequencing technology has produced precise information regarding gene-gene interactions. The Hi-C technique cross links chromosomes with themselves, revealing DNA-DNA interactions. These samples are then fragmented and ligated to produce small loops containing the DNA-to-DNA interaction sequences. Finally, a 2-D contact map is produced. While many suspect that patterns in the 2-D contact map reflect 3-D proximity of genes, this is difficult to discern. We use constrained molecular simulations to produce 3-D reconstructions of full chromosomes highly consistent with Hi-C experimental data for the process of X chromosome silencing, shedding light on the chromosome compaction. Changes in 3-D structure, could, in principle, be used to detect more subtle signatures of viral infections. In addition to full chromosome simulations, results from the first explicit solvent MD simulations of an entire gene locus (using the LANL Trinity supercomputer) will be presented. This pilot study is the first billion-atom simulation published in the biosciences. Simulations such as these have the ability to push HPC resources much more than conventional simulations in the physical sciences.

Talk title: Emergent spatial entanglement in many-body quantum systems 





Abstract: Are the global properties of complex quantum systems simply a consequence of the properties of their individual components? Or are there features that emerge, as a result of self-organisation, uniquely characterising the complex object as a whole? The answer to these questions might unveil up-to-now unknown properties of molecular complexes, proteins, and living organisms, as well as of engineered complex quantum communication networks. 



In this talk, I will show how our holistic approach combining quantum physics and complex network theory brings to light the existence of emergent spatial structures of quantum entanglement in a paradigmatic many-particle quantum system [1]. I will also introduce an efficient algorithm for quantum network tomography, showing exponential improvement with respect to existing approaches [2], and hence allowing for the experimental observation of the new entanglement structures that we have discovered.

Talk Title: Data Is People: Ethics and Education for Data Science

Talk Abstract: Big data has opened up new possibilities and transformed the ways we conduct research in nearly every discipline. However, ethical considerations and education for research has long focused on human subjects, governed in the U.S. by institutional review boards. Data science often falls through the cracks of these regulations, so it is even more imperative that we have strong ethical norms and guidelines. This starts with the reminder that though data scientists may not interact directly with people, the data collected and analyzed very often comes from people, which opens up important considerations around privacy, consent, and harm. Moreover, applications of data science research, particularly with respect to prediction, have the potential for large-scale societal impacts. In considering the broad landscape of technology ethics when it comes to uses and applications of big data, I will argue for a fundamental shift in how we teach ethics to future data scientists and researchers.

Who, where, why: non-traditional data and predictive analytics to map socio-economic vulnerabilities

Talk Abstract:
In a rapidly changing world, severely affected by extreme weather events, epidemic outbreaks, economic shocks and conflicts, it is of fundamental importance to understand where the most vulnerable people are, how many they are, and to identify what it is that makes them more vulnerable than others to these threats. During the last decade, research has shown that data such as digital traces, phone metadata and satellite imagery carry relevant information beyond their original purpose and can be used as a proxy to measure socio-economic characteristics and detect vulnerabilities when traditional data is not available. Following an overview of these studies, the talk will deep dive into the UN World Food Programme’s original work on predicting food security. We will then conclude by discussing challenges and limitations, but also opportunities, that come with these approaches.

Even when factually accurate, maps, like history, are shaped by their perspective, as well as countless decisions about what to include and what to leave out. This means that all maps will be biased. But it also means that simply pointing out this bias is only the first step toward trying to understand how and why they were created. In this talk, I draw on my experience with history, and the politics which surround the writing of it, to look at how maps can be used to understand the worldviews of the people who created them.

Talk Title: Modeling Shield Immunity — From Concept to Implementation

Abstract: Developing intervention strategies that can reduce transmission and alleviate the impacts of social distancing is an essential goal of long-term public health responses to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In this talk I will describe our efforts to develop models of ‘shield immunity’, i.e., leveraging serological testing and the increased interaction rates of recovered individuals to reduce new chains of transmission and foster safer economic re-engagement. I will then discuss initial steps to translate these principles into actions, including connecting serological test analytics and developing feasibility models for implementation in pilot settings.
