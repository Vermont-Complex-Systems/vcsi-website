# Governance Roles for the VCSI Website

This document describes the governance structure for the Vermont Complex Systems Institute (VCSI) website project. We maintain a lightweight governance model with two key groups: a **Core Team** that manages day-to-day operations and a **Steering Committee** that provides strategic direction.

## Overview

The VCSI website is a collaborative project maintained by members of the Vermont Complex Systems Institute. Our governance structure balances the need for effective decision-making with the goal of remaining open and welcoming to community contributions.

**Key Principles:**
- **Open Collaboration** - We welcome contributions from all VCSI community members
- **Transparency** - Decisions and processes are documented and accessible
- **Low Barrier to Entry** - Simple contributions (like CSV edits) require no special permissions
- **Community-Driven** - The website serves the needs of the VCSI community

## Core Team

The **Core Team** manages the day-to-day operations of the VCSI website, including:
- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Managing technical infrastructure and deployments
- Maintaining data quality (courses, publications, member profiles)
- Responding to issues and questions
- Ensuring the Code of Conduct is upheld

## Decision-Making Process

We follow a **lazy consensus** model for most decisions:

1. **Proposal** - Any community member can propose changes via issues or pull requests
2. **Discussion** - Core Team and community members discuss and provide feedback
3. **Waiting Period** - Allow 1-2 weeks for input (shorter for minor changes)
4. **Decision** - If no objections, the proposal is accepted; if concerns arise, the Core Team facilitates resolution

**For major decisions** (e.g., significant architectural changes, policy updates):
- Requires explicit approval from the Steering Committee
- Should be discussed at a monthly meeting or via email
- Documented in meeting notes or issue threads

## Community Participation

Everyone in the VCSI community can contribute to the website! Here's how:

**Easy Contributions (No Technical Setup):**
